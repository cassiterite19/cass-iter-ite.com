                        <p>art seemed to always be around us when i was very small. my grandmother, who helped take care of my older sister and i for several years, was a very craft-oriented person. she did it all: feltcrafts, oil painting, scrapbooking, cross stitch, crocheting. later she - and we - experiemented with soap making, candlemaking, and jewelrycrafts. she was an inspiration for the polymath i desire to become.</p>
                        <p>another inspiration was my older sister. she was great at drawing, and i especially liked her sonic the hedgehog fanart and her dragon pictures. but this was at a time when we were getting older, into high school, and i felt like drawing was <em>her</em> thing. (my thing, at the time, was computers; i was learning the contemporary methods of web development. anyone remember mootools? lol!)</p>

                        <h4>but none of that is recent.</h4>
                        <p>my current art journey began in 2021, as i was reading brandon sanderson's stormlight archives series for the first time. one of the main characters, shallan, is an artist who is extremely skilled at sketching and pencil drawings. i was inspired again, and this time enough to act. i went out and bought a sketchbook, though i originally began with ink.</p>
                        <p>i kept working in that sketchbook on and off until i filled it in 2023, branching into other mediums such as watercolor and crayola marker. i'm working on a second sketchbook now, in addition to watercolor paintings in various watercolor pads. i've also begun to sometimes add colored pencils to my work, and i've just got my hands on a set of oil pastels which i am excited to work with.</p>
                        <p>my favorite subject is kirby, and he liters my sketchbook. when i don't know what to draw, i draw kirby. he's very cute and easy to draw lol.</p>
